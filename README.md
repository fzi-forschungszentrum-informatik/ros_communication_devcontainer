# ROS Communication DevContainer

The ROS Communication DevContainer is a Docker-based solution designed to streamline the synchronization of ROS topics across Linux machines. It supports both ROS1 (Noetic) and ROS2, with built-in compression capabilities for efficient data transfer. This project aligns with the publication "Scalable Remote Operation for Autonomous Vehicles: Integration of Cooperative Perception and Open Source Communication."

<details>
<summary>Key Features</summary>

- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only Docker is needed to get started, simplifying the setup process.
- **Isolation**: Operates in a separate Docker container, ensuring minimal impact on existing ROS setups.
- **Centralized Configuration Management**: All configurations are stored and managed in this repository.
- **Cross-ROS Support**: Compatible with both ROS1 Noetic and ROS2.
- **Advanced Compression**: Built-in compression capabilities for efficient data transfer.
- **QoS Configuration**: Flexible Quality of Service settings for optimized communication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on all machines
- Git for configuration management
- Machines connected to the same network (VPN or local WLAN)

### Basic Setup

1. Fork this repository
2. Configure your environment:
   - `data_dict.json`: Maps semantic names to resources (example in `config/examples/data_dict.json`)
   - `local.json`: Container-specific settings (example in `config/examples/local.json`)

### Configuration Files

Two main configuration types:

1. **Session Configuration**:
   - `session_specification.yaml`: Defines communication session structure
   - `[plugin_name].yaml`: Individual plugin configurations

2. **Compression Configuration** (Optional):
   - Configure compression settings for specific topics
   - Support for multiple compression algorithms

## Usage Examples

### Starting Points: Examples

To help you get started, we have provided several examples that showcase the basic functionality of the ROS Communication DevContainer. These examples are designed for ease of use and quick setup.

<details>
<summary>Configuring Machine Data</summary>

The examples require two machines, which we will refer to as `machine_a` and `machine_b`. Choose your machines and fill out the `machine_a_ip` and `machine_b_ip` fields in your `data_dict.json`. Make sure this data is synchronized across both machines via Git to ensure seamless communication.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example 1: Hello World</summary>

This example checks if the ROS Communication DevContainer can be started successfully.

- On any machine, run the script:
  ```bash
  ./example/1_hello_world_session/run.sh
  ```
- Confirm that a hello world statement gets printed.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example 2: Multi-Machine Direct Communication</summary>

This example demonstrates ROS2 communication between distinct machines using direct communication.

- On `machine_a`, execute:
  ```bash
  ./example/2_multi_machine_direct/run_machine_a.sh
  ```
- On `machine_b`, execute:
  ```bash
  ./example/2_multi_machine_direct/run_machine_b.sh
  ```
- Confirm that the listener on `machine_a` acknowledges the messages from the talker on `machine_b`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example 3: Multi-Machine Relay Communication</summary>

This example demonstrates ROS2 communication between distinct machines using relay nodes.

- On `machine_a`, execute:
  ```bash
  ./example/3_multi_machine_relay/run_machine_a.sh
  ```
- On `machine_b`, execute:
  ```bash
  ./example/3_multi_machine_relay/run_machine_b.sh
  ```
- Confirm that the listener on `machine_a` acknowledges the messages from the talker on `machine_b`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example 4: External Master</summary>

This example adds a layer of separation between the main logic and communication, allowing existing local ROS1 code to remain unchanged.

- On `machine_a`, navigate to `example/4_external_master/machine_a` and execute the following commands in separate terminals:
  - `./run_master.py`
  - `./run_communication.sh`
- On `machine_b`, navigate to `example/4_external_master/machine_b` and execute the following commands in separate terminals:
  - `./run_master.py`
  - `./run_communication.sh`
- Confirm that the master on `machine_a` acknowledges the messages from the master on `machine_b`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Example 5: Showcase</summary>

This example demonstrates handling more complex data, such as an occupancy grid map, which is larger and therefore uses compression.

- On `machine_a`, navigate to `example/5_showcase/machine_a` and execute the following commands in separate terminals:
  - `./run_master.py`
  - `./run_communication.sh`
- On `machine_b`, navigate to `example/5_showcase/machine_b` and execute the following commands in separate terminals:
  - `./run_master.py`
  - `./run_communication.sh`
- Confirm that the master on `machine_a` acknowledges the compressed messages from the master on `machine_b`.

The showcase example includes:
- ROS1 to ROS2 bridge functionality
- Automatic topic compression and decompression
- QoS configuration for optimized communication
- Heartbeat monitoring between machines

</details>

## Advanced Features

### Compression Support

The system includes universal compression capabilities for ROS topics:

```yaml
compression:
  - topic_regex: ".*"
    algorithm: "bz2"  # Optional, defaults to bz2
    add_suffix: "_compressed"  # Optional
```

### Cross-ROS Communication

Support for both ROS1 and ROS2 environments:
- Bridge nodes for cross-version communication
- Automatic topic discovery and mapping
- Configurable QoS settings
